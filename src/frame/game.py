def number_guessing_game():
    ...
    # Your code here:
    # 1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    # 2. Initialize a counter for the number of guesses
    # 3. Create a loop that:
    #    - Gets a valid guess from the player
    #    - Increments the guess counter
    #    - Tells if the guess is too high, too low, or correct
    # 4. When the player guesses correctly, end the game and show the number of guesses

    # Example output:
    # I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
    # Your guess: 50
    # Too high!
    # Your guess: 25
    # Too high!
    # Your guess: 12
    # Too low!
    # Your guess: 18
    # You got it! The number was 18.
    # It took you 4 guesses.


# Run the game
